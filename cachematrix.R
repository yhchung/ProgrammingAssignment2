## Creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix().
## If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has not changed,
## then it retrieve the inverse from cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
